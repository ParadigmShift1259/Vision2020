# Vision Setup
Part of vision this year will include a camera server running on the pi which sends a feed of the camera back to the driver station and the same feed is used for vision processing. 

In order to accomplish this task we have downloaded a python multiCameraServer.py example file which can be found here:

Go to: http://frcvision.local/
>* Select the Application tab
>* At the bottom you should see a button to download a Java example, C++ example, and a Python example
>* Download the Python example
>* Extract the multiCameraServer.py file from the zip file and upload the file by doing the following:
>	* In the Application Tab on the dashboard, there is an option to upload a file, upload that file
>	* On the file system this sile should show up as uploaded.py
>	* Changes made to this file will be applied after a reboot
